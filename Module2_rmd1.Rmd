## R Markdown

### This is level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [Google](http://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_

When we compile a document, we are using a  `rmarkdown` package

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
        
* Lunch
    - taco
    
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice

Here is an example of a numbered list 

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
        
2. Lunch
    a. taco
    
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice
    
Here is an example of block quote: (leave 4 spaces)

> This is a block quote. This   
> paragraph has two line
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote
> 2. Second item.

Here is an example of a nested block quote:

> This is a block quote. This   
> paragraph has two lines 
>
> > This text is nested

Here is an example of code in blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
